description: Write a bridge proposal to ``bridge/<topic>-001.md`` and insert its entry into ``bridge/INDEX.md`` under governance-safe credential-scan and concurrency controls. Use when drafting a new NEW or REVISED proposal through the helper path (non-Claude-Write).
---

This skill implements the helper-mediated bridge-write path. It is the
safe alternative to persisting proposal bodies through non-Write code
paths (``file.write_bytes``, ``shutil.copy2``, etc.) that are outside
the ``scanner-safe-writer`` hook's Write-tool trigger scope.

# /gtkb-bridge-propose

## What this skill does

Takes a topic slug and a proposal body, scans the body against the
canonical credential catalog (``CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS + BASH_EXTRAS``,
PII excluded), writes ``bridge/<topic>-001.md``, and inserts a
``Document: <topic>`` + ``NEW: bridge/<topic>-001.md`` entry at the
top of ``bridge/INDEX.md``.

Every implementation proposal must include a ``Specification Links`` section
before it can be submitted. The section must cite every relevant governing
specification using concrete spec IDs or specification/rule file paths.
Placeholder values such as ``TBD``, ``N/A``, or ``no relevant specs`` are hard
errors: create or update the needed specification first, then submit the
proposal.

Loyal Opposition MUST reject all implementation proposals that are not linked to
specifications. Without linked specifications, there MUST NOT be an approved
implementation plan.

Two options are offered on a credential hit:

- **Abort** — no file is written, no INDEX entry is added.
- **Redact** — credential-shaped spans are replaced with
  ``[REDACTED:<label>]`` markers. Redacted content is re-scanned. If
  the second scan still finds hits, the skill aborts with an
  explicit ``RedactionResidualError`` — this is a bug, not a
  recoverable user state.

**There is no Force option.** Helper writes are outside the
``scanner-safe-writer`` hook's Write-tool trigger scope, so a bypass
here would silently persist credential-shaped text without an
auditable deny record. Callers who genuinely need to document
credential-shaped values (test fixtures, rotation runbooks) should
use prose descriptions or runtime-assembled test fixtures — not a
helper bypass.

## When to invoke

Use this skill when:

- Drafting a new NEW bridge proposal from session context
- Writing a REVISED version after a NO-GO (pick a fresh file name
  with incremented version suffix)
- Any helper-driven code path that needs to persist a bridge
  proposal body to disk under governance

Do NOT use for:

- Editing an existing bridge file (Edit tool is the correct path)
- Writing non-bridge files (``bridge/INDEX.md`` is managed by the
  skill; other files are out of scope)
- Persisting credential-shaped content (redaction is the only
  legitimate path; force-write is not available)

## How it works

Invokes ``helpers/write_bridge.py``'s ``propose_bridge()`` with the
caller-supplied ``topic_slug``, ``body``, and optional metadata.

### Phase 1 — Pre-flight scan

Before credential scanning, ``validate_specification_links(body)`` requires a
``Specification Links`` section with concrete spec IDs or specification/rule
file paths. This gate runs before file writes, credential redaction, and INDEX
mutation. It cannot prove the list is complete; Loyal Opposition still must
review completeness and issue NO-GO if any relevant specification is omitted.

``scan_credential_hits(body)`` iterates ``CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS +
BASH_EXTRAS`` (PII patterns are intentionally excluded, same policy
as ``scanner-safe-writer``). Returns list of hits; empty list means
the body is clean.

### Phase 2 — Hit resolution

If hits are non-empty, the caller must pass ``mode="abort"`` or
``mode="redact"``:

- ``abort`` raises ``CredentialHitsFoundError`` with the first hit's
  ``pattern_name`` and description.
- ``redact`` normalizes hit intervals (sort by ``(start, -end)``,
  merge overlaps, outer label wins), applies replacements in
  reverse-start order, then re-scans the redacted body. If the
  second scan returns any hits, ``RedactionResidualError`` is
  raised.

### Phase 3 — File-first write

``bridge/<topic_slug>-001.md`` is written atomically. If the file
already exists (for example, from a prior partial attempt with the
same slug), ``BridgeFileAlreadyExistsError`` is raised before any
INDEX touch. The skill never silently overwrites.

### Phase 4 — INDEX insertion with retry

The ``Document: <topic_slug>`` + ``NEW: bridge/<topic_slug>-001.md``
entry is inserted at the top of ``bridge/INDEX.md`` (after leading
comment lines). The write uses a temp-file + atomic ``os.replace``
pattern. If INDEX.md changes between the read and the rename, or if
another writer already inserted an entry for the same topic, the
write is retried once. Total budget: **2 attempts** (1 initial + 1
retry). On second failure, ``BridgeIndexConflictError`` surfaces
with an actionable message (the bridge file is already on disk;
manually add an INDEX entry or retry the skill).

## Errors

- ``CredentialHitsFoundError`` — hits found and ``mode="abort"``.
- ``RedactionResidualError`` — second scan after redaction still
  finds hits. Indicates a catalog/redactor bug, not a user state.
- ``BridgeFileAlreadyExistsError`` — target file already on disk;
  skill refuses to overwrite.
- ``BridgeIndexConflictError`` — INDEX.md changed during the write,
  or another writer inserted an entry for the same topic. Retry
  budget exhausted after 2 total attempts.
