## Prior Deliberations

- `DELIB-20265586` - Owner project authorization for the snapshot-bound Agent Red test coverage gap project.
- `DELIB-0712` - POR Step 16.B methodology review classifying assertion-only and stale-evidence coverage gaps for remediation.
- `DELIB-0713` - Owner accepted multi-stream remediation and rejected assertion-only verification for normal behavioral requirements.
- `DELIB-0333` - S251 advisory review for SPEC-1864/1865/1866; establishes conversation-document override state and scalar router input.
- `DELIB-0337` - S252 advisory review; identifies cold-cache validation and overlay/private-scope parity risks.
- `DELIB-0341` - S252 v2 NO-GO; verifies default skill and overlay/private-scope fixes but calls out remaining cold-cache validation.

## Specifications Carried Forward

- `SPEC-1866` - Direct requirement for conversation-level agent activation and router precedence.
- `SPEC-1861` - IntentRouter boundary and route targets.
- `SPEC-1854` - Per-tenant overlay activation.
- `SPEC-1856` - Skill binding existence and enabled-state.
- `SPEC-1862` - Team-member direct agent context.
- `GOV-10` - Test artifacts must exercise exposed project artifacts; here the live admin conversation API, conversation document fields, IntentRouter, overlay, and binding surfaces are the exposed artifacts under test.
- `SPEC-1649` - Master test plan/live-interface policy; repository-native pytest evidence must validate live code rather than rely on stale assertion rows.
- `GOV-12` - Work-item remediation must create test evidence.
- `GOV-13` - Test visibility/phase governance; repository-native pytest mappings are live spec-to-test evidence under the current FAB-11 amendment.
- `GOV-PROJECT-IMPLEMENTATION-AUTHORIZATION-001` - Project-scoped owner authorization is required but does not replace bridge review, `GO`, target paths, implementation-start packet, report, or verification.
- `SPEC-CODE-QUALITY-CHECKLIST-001` - Applies baseline Python lint and formatting checks to the new test file.
- `GOV-FILE-BRIDGE-AUTHORITY-001` - Governs status-bearing bridge file authority, role eligibility, and numbered append-only bridge chains.
- `DCL-IMPLEMENTATION-PROPOSAL-SPEC-LINKAGE-MANDATORY-001` - Requires this proposal to cite all relevant specifications.
- `DCL-VERIFIED-SPEC-DERIVED-TESTING-MANDATORY-001` - Requires implementation verification to map linked specs to executed tests.
- `DCL-BRIDGE-PROPOSAL-PROJECT-LINKAGE-MANDATORY-001` - Requires project authorization, project id, and work-item metadata lines.
- `ADR-ISOLATION-APPLICATION-PLACEMENT-001` - Confirms Agent Red application artifacts live under `applications/Agent_Red/`.
- `GOV-STANDING-BACKLOG-001` - Governs backlog/work-item handling; this proposal uses the existing authorized WI and does not add project scope.
- `ADR-CODEX-HOOK-PARITY-FALLBACK-001` - Codex must use governed bridge helper paths and explicit preflight evidence rather than assuming hook parity.
- `ADR-ARTIFACT-ORIENTED-DEVELOPMENT-001` - Requires durable bridge/test evidence for implementation work.
- `GOV-ARTIFACT-ORIENTED-GOVERNANCE-001` - Requires implementation intent and review evidence to be preserved as governed artifacts.
- `DCL-ARTIFACT-LIFECYCLE-TRIGGERS-001` - Frames this implementation proposal as a lifecycle artifact for the work item.

## Review Assessment

We have reviewed the proposal and agree that the proposed scope is valid and required. The conversation-level agent activation (saving overrides to the conversation document and router prioritization check) should be regression tested in a dedicated test suite mapping to `SPEC-1866`.

The proposed target path `applications/Agent_Red/tests/unit/test_conversation_agent_activation_spec1866.py` is appropriate and correctly isolated under the `applications/Agent_Red/` subtree.

## Positive Confirmations

- Inspected the existing activation surfaces (`applications/Agent_Red/src/multi_tenant/cosmos_schema.py`, `admin_conversation_api.py`, etc.) and routing check (`intent_router.py`) and confirmed they expose the behaviors targeted by the tests.
- Confirmed the proposal is structurally compliant and includes all required sections and links.
