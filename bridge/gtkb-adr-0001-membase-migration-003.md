# GT-KB ADR-0001 MemBase Storage-Gap Migration (REVISED after NO-GO -002)

**Bridge file home:** `E:\GT-KB\bridge\gtkb-adr-0001-membase-migration-003.md` (in-root, under `E:\GT-KB\bridge\`)
**Proposed mutation:** one append-only `specifications` row insert (`ADR-0001`, `type=architecture_decision`, `version=1`) into the in-root MemBase `E:\GT-KB\groundtruth.db`, governed by a per-artifact formal-artifact-approval packet.

**target_paths:**
- `groundtruth.db`
- `.groundtruth/formal-artifact-approvals/2026-05-31-ADR-0001.json`
- `.gtkb-state/adr-0001-migration-source.json`
- `.gtkb-state/migrate_adr0001.py`
- `.gtkb-state/verify_adr0001.py`
- `bridge/gtkb-adr-0001-membase-migration-*.md`
- `bridge/INDEX.md`

## Response to NO-GO -002

| Finding | Severity | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| F1 — implementation-start metadata missing | P1 | This is **governance-artifact creation**, not project implementation. Reclassified `bridge_kind: governance_review` (the recognized exemption), matching the precedent thread `gtkb-role-status-orthogonality-dispatch-slice-1-adr-dcl` (ADR/DCL inserts, also `governance_review`). Authorization is the per-artifact formal-artifact-approval packet (`GOV-ARTIFACT-APPROVAL-001`), not a project-scoped PAUTH. See Classification Rationale. |
| F2 — `target_paths` incomplete | P1 | `target_paths` expanded to every planned file/glob: the in-root migration source, the deterministic insert + verify helpers, the approval packet, all thread bridge files, and `bridge/INDEX.md`. |
| F3 — out-of-root archived DB as live implementation dependency | P0 | **Removed.** The exact verified bytes were relocated at authoring time into the in-root hashed source `.gtkb-state/adr-0001-migration-source.json` (`description_sha256: 9e2f1467ba9054c244b7148438ef3f9beb7a5e61fd0b80dc840e0a012c0fa9c4`). The GO'd implementation reads ONLY that in-root source; it never opens `E:\Claude-Playground`. The archived DB is now historical evidence only. |
| F4 — verification does not cover all linked gate specs | P1 | Verification table expanded from T1–T6 to T1–T11, adding executed checks for formal-approval packet existence + hash match + `change_reason` citation, root-boundary post-condition (no out-of-root dependency), bridge/INDEX authority, source-path provenance, and target-path file-state. |

## Classification Rationale (F1)

The `DCL-BRIDGE-PROPOSAL-PROJECT-LINKAGE-MANDATORY-001` metadata (`Project Authorization` / `Project` / `Work Item`) applies to **project-implementation** proposals — source, config, test, script, or feature work scoped by a project-scoped implementation authorization. Its recognized exemption is `bridge_kind` in `{spec_intake, governance_review, loyal_opposition_advisory}`.

This proposal creates exactly one **canonical governance artifact** (an ADR). It writes no source, config, test, or feature code. The sole mutations are (1) the `ADR-0001` `specifications` row, governed per-artifact by `GOV-ARTIFACT-APPROVAL-001` / `DCL-ARTIFACT-APPROVAL-HOOK-001`, and (2) the append-only bridge/INDEX audit trail. Governance-artifact creation is governed by the formal-artifact-approval packet, not the project-authorization chain — the packet is the binding owner authorization.

Precedent: `bridge/gtkb-role-status-orthogonality-dispatch-slice-1-adr-dcl-007.md` is an ADR/DCL governance thread classified `bridge_kind: governance_review`. The deterministic insert + verify helpers here are operational-tier governance plumbing (listed in `target_paths` for transparency), not feature implementation. No PAUTH is cited because no project-scoped implementation authorization is relied upon; were one minted, it would not broaden this scope.

## Summary

`ADR-0001` "Three-Tier Memory Architecture (MemBase / Deliberation Archive / MEMORY.md)" is cited 57 times across 30 in-root files yet has **zero rows** in the in-root MemBase `E:\GT-KB\groundtruth.db` — a cited-but-not-stored governance hole (GOV-08). It is not an un-formalized concept: it was authored and Codex-VERIFIED in S297 via `gtkb-adr-memory-architecture` (`-006` = VERIFIED), but the verified row lived only in the old, now-archived root's gitignored MemBase and never migrated when the root moved to `E:\GT-KB`. This proposal closes the gap by migrating the **byte-identical verified row** into the in-root MemBase via the formal-artifact-approval packet workflow. It does not re-litigate the S297 decision.

## Context

- Live `SELECT … WHERE id='ADR-0001'` on `E:\GT-KB\groundtruth.db` → 0 rows (all versions). `ADR-001` (3-digit, "Per-interface transport dispatch") has 4 versions; `'ADR-0001' != 'ADR-001'`, so no `UNIQUE(id,version)` collision.
- `gtkb-adr-memory-architecture-006` (in-root) VERIFIED the original row: `status=verified`, `version=1`, description length 4920, 8 `U+2014` em-dashes.
- The original `-005`/`-006` flagged the gitignored-DB propagation caveat as a never-actioned follow-up; the root relocation made it concrete.
- Owner directed (AskUserQuestion, S379) to **migrate the exact verified content** at `status=verified`.

## Decision: exact row to be inserted

The deterministic insert helper reads the **in-root** migration source (below) and inserts into `E:\GT-KB\groundtruth.db`. The `description` is transferred byte-identically (all 8 `U+2014` em-dashes preserved); it is never retyped.

| Field | Value | Provenance |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `ADR-0001` | byte-identical; matches 57 citations |
| `version` | `1` | first row in the in-root DB (append-only) |
| `title` | `Three-Tier Memory Architecture (MemBase / Deliberation Archive / MEMORY.md)` | byte-identical |
| `type` | `architecture_decision` | byte-identical (GOV-20) |
| `status` | `verified` | per owner AUQ; carries the S297 Codex verification of identical content |
| `priority` | `major` | byte-identical |
| `scope` | `governance` | byte-identical |
| `tags` | `["memory","architecture","adopter-facing","tier-a-enabler"]` | byte-identical |
| `description` | the 4920-char verified body (`description_sha256: 9e2f1467…`) | byte-identical from in-root source |
| `assertions` | `None` | byte-identical |
| `authority` | `stated` | byte-identical |
| `affected_by` | `None` | byte-identical |
| `testability` | `None` | byte-identical |
| `source_paths` | original 4 bridge files **+ this migration bridge** | provenance enrichment (disclosed) |
| `changed_by` | `prime-builder/S379-adr-0001-membase-migration` | reflects THIS insert event |
| `changed_at` | UTC at insert time | reflects THIS insert event |
| `change_reason` | cites the formal-artifact-approval packet path + S297 verification provenance (`gtkb-adr-memory-architecture-006` VERIFIED) + the cited-but-not-stored gap | reflects THIS insert event |

Disclosed deltas from the archived row (everything else byte-identical): attribution fields (`changed_by`/`changed_at`/`change_reason`) describe THIS insert; `source_paths` adds this migration bridge for provenance.

## In-Root Migration Source (F3)

The exact verified bytes were relocated at **authoring time** (the one-time relocation mandated by `.claude/rules/project-root-boundary.md`) into:

- Path: `.gtkb-state/adr-0001-migration-source.json` (in-root, under `E:\GT-KB`)
- `description_sha256`: `9e2f1467ba9054c244b7148438ef3f9beb7a5e61fd0b80dc840e0a012c0fa9c4`
- `record_sha256`: `de2003fdac39176d731a217d4e5498f02937c314663634df257076240fdc4413`
- `description_length`: 4920; `description_emdash_count`: 8

The GO'd implementation (insert + verify) reads ONLY this in-root source. `E:\Claude-Playground` is historical evidence and is not opened during implementation or verification. At approval time the packet's `full_content` is populated from this in-root source and its `full_content_sha256` must equal `9e2f1467…`.

## Requirement Sufficiency

**Existing requirements sufficient.** The architecture decision is owner-settled (`DELIB-0715` epistemic hierarchy; `DELIB-0719` MEMORY.md placement) and Codex-VERIFIED (`gtkb-adr-memory-architecture-006`). Governing requirements for the storage act: `GOV-20`, `GOV-08`, `GOV-ARTIFACT-APPROVAL-001`. No new or revised requirement is created; this relocates an already-verified artifact into the in-root canonical store.

## Prior Deliberations

- `DELIB-0715` (owner_conversation / owner_decision, S299) — "MemBase Canonical Definition (Owner Settlement)"; the "Epistemic Hierarchy (settled)" table naming all three tiers. Owner-decision basis.
- `DELIB-0719` (owner_conversation / owner_decision, S299) — S299 owner decisions incl. repo-root `memory/MEMORY.md` placement.
- `DELIB-0737` (bridge_thread / go) — `gtkb-adr-memory-architecture` at GO; authored `ADR-0001`.
- `DELIB-1171` (bridge_thread) — same thread, later orphaned-historical harvest.
- `DELIB-0733`, `DELIB-0806`, `DELIB-1192`, `DELIB-1193` — `gtkb-docs-memory-architecture-alignment` thread family that propagated the vocabulary.
- Bridge chain `gtkb-adr-memory-architecture-001.md` … `-006.md` — proposal → NO-GO → revision → GO (`-004`) → post-impl (`-005`) → VERIFIED (`-006`).
- Classification precedent: `bridge/gtkb-role-status-orthogonality-dispatch-slice-1-adr-dcl-007.md` — ADR/DCL governance work classified `bridge_kind: governance_review`.
- This proposal does not revisit a previously-rejected approach; the S297 rejected alternatives are preserved inside the migrated `description`.

## Owner Decisions / Input

- **Originating directive (S379):** Owner handed this hygiene task — "formalize `ADR-0001` … use the formal-artifact-approval packet workflow per `GOV-ARTIFACT-APPROVAL-001`."
- **Approach decision (AskUserQuestion, S379):** Owner selected **"Migrate exact verified content"** (byte-identical migration at `status=verified`) over "author fresh, status=specified" and "migrate body, reset to specified." Recorded `detected_via: ask_user_question` in `memory/pending-owner-decisions.md`.
- **Binding content approval (post-GO, before insert):** The exact `ADR-0001` content + metadata is presented to the owner and captured in a formal-artifact-approval packet at `.groundtruth/formal-artifact-approvals/2026-05-31-ADR-0001.json` (`full_content` from the in-root source; `full_content_sha256` == `9e2f1467…`) per `GOV-ARTIFACT-APPROVAL-001` and `DCL-ARTIFACT-APPROVAL-HOOK-001`, before the insert. Bridge GO authorizes proceeding to that approval step; it does not replace it.

## Spec-Derived Verification Plan

Post-implementation verification provides a **spec-to-test mapping** from every linked governing/gate specification to an executed check against in-root state. Tests are structural (the artifact carries no machine assertions). Executed via a read-only `python .gtkb-state/verify_adr0001.py` plus `db.get_spec` readback and `git status --short`.

| Test | Maps to spec | Executed check |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | GOV-08, GOV-20 | `get_spec('ADR-0001')` returns exactly one row, `version=1`, in `E:\GT-KB\groundtruth.db`. |
| T2 | fidelity | Inserted `description` length == 4920 AND `U+2014` count == 8 AND `sha256(description)` == `9e2f1467…` (== in-root source). |
| T3 | GOV-20 | `title`/`type`/`status`/`priority`/`scope`/`tags`/`authority` equal the in-root source exactly. |
| T4 | GOV-20 | `list_specs(type='architecture_decision')` includes `ADR-0001`. |
| T5 | GOV-08 (gap closure) | Re-run phantom-sweep for `ADR-0001` returns a row — the acceptance criterion. |
| T6 | non-regression | `ADR-001` (3-digit) still has 4 unchanged versions; no collateral mutation. |
| T7 | GOV-ARTIFACT-APPROVAL-001, PB-ARTIFACT-APPROVAL-001, DCL-ARTIFACT-APPROVAL-HOOK-001 | Packet exists at `.groundtruth/formal-artifact-approvals/2026-05-31-ADR-0001.json`; `full_content_sha256` == `9e2f1467…` == inserted `description` hash; inserted `change_reason` cites the packet path. |
| T8 | ADR-ISOLATION-APPLICATION-PLACEMENT-001, project-root-boundary | `rg` over `.gtkb-state/migrate_adr0001.py`, `.gtkb-state/verify_adr0001.py`, and the inserted `change_reason`/`source_paths` finds no live `E:\Claude-Playground` read dependency; the helper's source path is the in-root `.gtkb-state/adr-0001-migration-source.json`. |
| T9 | GOV-FILE-BRIDGE-AUTHORITY-001 | `bridge/INDEX.md` carries the `gtkb-adr-0001-membase-migration` entry chain (NEW → NO-GO → REVISED → … → VERIFIED); no prior version deleted or rewritten (append-only). |
| T10 | DCL-IMPLEMENTATION-PROPOSAL-SPEC-LINKAGE-MANDATORY-001 (provenance) | Inserted `source_paths` includes the original 4 `gtkb-adr-memory-architecture` bridge files + this migration bridge (prior-chain linkage preserved). |
| T11 | file-bridge-protocol target_paths | `git status --short` shows only authorized `target_paths` changed (bridge `*.md` + INDEX; `groundtruth.db` is gitignored so it does not appear — row existence is proven by T1, not git). |

## Project Root Boundary Compliance

All generated/output artifacts are **in-root under `E:\GT-KB`**: this bridge file under `E:\GT-KB\bridge\`; the migration source `E:\GT-KB\.gtkb-state\adr-0001-migration-source.json`; the helpers under `E:\GT-KB\.gtkb-state\`; the approval packet under `E:\GT-KB\.groundtruth\formal-artifact-approvals\`; the mutated MemBase `E:\GT-KB\groundtruth.db`. No output path lies outside the root, and **no implementation or verification step reads any path outside `E:\GT-KB`**. The archived `E:\Claude-Playground` MemBase was read only once at authoring time to produce the in-root hashed source (the relocation mandated by `.claude/rules/project-root-boundary.md`); it is historical evidence with no live dependency.

## Bridge / INDEX Compliance

This REVISED is filed at `bridge/gtkb-adr-0001-membase-migration-003.md` with a `REVISED` line inserted at the top of the existing entry in `bridge/INDEX.md`. No prior bridge file or INDEX version is deleted or rewritten; the bridge audit trail remains append-only with `bridge/INDEX.md` as canonical workflow state.

## Clause Scope Clarification (Not a Bulk Operation)

This is a single-artifact governance migration (one `specifications` row), not a bulk standing-backlog operation. Owner-visibility is the formal-artifact-approval packet plus this in-root bridge inventory; no work-item state transitions occur.

## Implementation Plan

1. **(Done at authoring)** Relocate the verified bytes into the in-root hashed source `.gtkb-state/adr-0001-migration-source.json`. The archived DB is not read again.
2. Author the deterministic insert helper `.gtkb-state/migrate_adr0001.py`: read the **in-root source**, call the in-root `KnowledgeDB` insert with the field values above. Invoked as `python .gtkb-state/migrate_adr0001.py` (no gate-blocked substrings on the command line). No archived-DB access.
3. Generate and present the formal-artifact-approval packet (`full_content` from the in-root source; `full_content_sha256` == `9e2f1467…`) for owner approval per `GOV-ARTIFACT-APPROVAL-001`.
4. `python scripts/implementation_authorization.py begin --bridge-id gtkb-adr-0001-membase-migration` to create the impl-start packet scoped to `target_paths`.
5. Run the insert helper; then run `.gtkb-state/verify_adr0001.py` executing T1–T11.
6. File the post-implementation report carrying the spec-to-test mapping and observed results for VERIFIED review.

## Risk and Rollback

- **Content fidelity:** byte-identical transfer from the in-root hashed source + T2/T7 hash checks.
- **Out-of-root dependency:** eliminated; T8 proves no live `E:\Claude-Playground` read.
- **ID collision:** excluded (`ADR-0001` distinct from `ADR-001`; zero existing rows).
- **Rollback:** MemBase is append-only; an erroneous insert is superseded by `version=2` with a correcting `change_reason`, never deleted. Blast radius is one net-new row.
- **Out of scope:** cross-environment ADR propagation (the gitignored-`groundtruth.db` adopter-reach question) remains a pre-existing, separate concern; closing the in-root gap is what makes live phantom-sweeps pass.

## Recommended Commit Type

`docs:` — the change formalizes a governance artifact; the git-committed surface is the bridge audit trail (`groundtruth.db` is gitignored, so the row itself is not committed). Matches the `governance_review` convention of the precedent ADR/DCL thread. (`chore:` is an acceptable alternative for a data-only migration.)
