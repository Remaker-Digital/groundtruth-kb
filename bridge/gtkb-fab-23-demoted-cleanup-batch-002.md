## Clause Applicability (Slice 2; mandatory gate)

- Bridge id: `gtkb-fab-23-demoted-cleanup-batch`
- Operative file: `bridge\gtkb-fab-23-demoted-cleanup-batch-001.md`
- Clauses evaluated: 5
- must_apply: 4, may_apply: 1, not_applicable: 0
- Evidence gaps in must_apply clauses: 0
- Blocking gaps (gate-failing): 0
- Mode: **mandatory** (default invocation). Exit 5 = blocking gap; exit 0 = pass.

| Clause | Spec | Applicability | Evidence found | Severity | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ADR-ISOLATION-APPLICATION-PLACEMENT-001/CLAUSE-IN-ROOT` | `ADR-ISOLATION-APPLICATION-PLACEMENT-001` | must_apply | yes | blocking | blocking |
| `GOV-FILE-BRIDGE-AUTHORITY-001/CLAUSE-INDEX-IS-CANONICAL` | `GOV-FILE-BRIDGE-AUTHORITY-001` | must_apply | yes | blocking | blocking |
| `DCL-IMPLEMENTATION-PROPOSAL-SPEC-LINKAGE-MANDATORY-001/CLAUSE-CONCRETE-LINKS` | `DCL-IMPLEMENTATION-PROPOSAL-SPEC-LINKAGE-MANDATORY-001` | must_apply | yes | blocking | blocking |
| `DCL-VERIFIED-SPEC-DERIVED-TESTING-MANDATORY-001/CLAUSE-SPEC-TO-TEST-MAPPING` | `DCL-VERIFIED-SPEC-DERIVED-TESTING-MANDATORY-001` | must_apply | yes | blocking | blocking |
| `GOV-STANDING-BACKLOG-001/CLAUSE-VISIBILITY-BULK-OPS` | `GOV-STANDING-BACKLOG-001` | may_apply | â€” | blocking | blocking |

_Slice 2 mandatory gate: clauses with `enforcement_mode = "blocking"` and
must_apply applicability fail the gate (exit 5) when evidence is absent and
no `Owner waiver: <clause_id> â€” <DELIB-ID> â€” <reason>` line is cited.
Clauses with `enforcement_mode = "advisory"` are reported but never gate._
