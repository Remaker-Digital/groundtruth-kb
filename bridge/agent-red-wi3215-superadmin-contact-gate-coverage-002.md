## Prior Deliberations

- **[DELIB-20265586](file:///E:/GT-KB/knowledge_base/deliberations/DELIB-20265586.md)**: Owner decision authorizing bounded implementation snapshot.
- **[DELIB-0712](file:///E:/GT-KB/knowledge_base/deliberations/DELIB-0712.md)**: Methodology review classifying phantom-only and stale-evidence coverage gaps for remediation.
- **[DELIB-0713](file:///E:/GT-KB/knowledge_base/deliberations/DELIB-0713.md)**: Owner accepted multi-stream remediation and rejected assertion-only verification.

## Specifications Carried Forward

- `SPEC-1882` - Superadmin Contact Requirement - hard provisioning gate.
- `GOV-10` - Tests must exercise exposed production behavior.
- `SPEC-1649` - Master test plan live-interface discipline.
- `GOV-12` - Work item-driven test addition.
- `GOV-13` - Backlog/project execution discipline.
- `GOV-PROJECT-IMPLEMENTATION-AUTHORIZATION-001` - Bounded owner authorization for the coverage gap project.
- `SPEC-CODE-QUALITY-CHECKLIST-001` - Applies baseline Python lint and formatting checks.
- `GOV-FILE-BRIDGE-AUTHORITY-001` - Governs status-bearing bridge file authority and chain.
- `DCL-IMPLEMENTATION-PROPOSAL-SPEC-LINKAGE-MANDATORY-001` - Link specifications to proposal.
- `DCL-VERIFIED-SPEC-DERIVED-TESTING-MANDATORY-001` - Verification must map specifications to tests.
- `DCL-BRIDGE-PROPOSAL-PROJECT-LINKAGE-MANDATORY-001` - Links project, PAUTH, and WI.
- `ADR-ISOLATION-APPLICATION-PLACEMENT-001` - Placement within application subdirectory.
- `GOV-STANDING-BACKLOG-001` - Backlog and work-item execution discipline.
- `ADR-ARTIFACT-ORIENTED-DEVELOPMENT-001` - Preserve artifact-based development.
- `GOV-ARTIFACT-ORIENTED-GOVERNANCE-001` - Durable artifact preservation.
- `DCL-ARTIFACT-LIFECYCLE-TRIGGERS-001` - Lifecycle states tracking.

## Review Assessment

We have reviewed the proposal and agree that the proposed scope is valid and required. The superadmin contact requirement fixes will prevent contactless tenant provisioning across billing channels, including trials, and register a background scanner that deactivates existing contactless active tenants according to `SPEC-1882`.

The proposed target paths and test files are appropriate and correctly isolated under the `applications/Agent_Red/` subtree.

## Positive Confirmations

- Confirmed that all proposed files are within the `E:\GT-KB` mandatory project root.
- Inspected the adjacent tests in `applications/Agent_Red/tests/` to verify no redundant test code is introduced.
- Checked the specification-to-test verification plan and verified that it covers all necessary correctness, safety, and read-only invariants.
- Confirmed the proposal is structurally compliant and includes all required sections and links.
