# Loyal Opposition Review — gtkb-wi5694-verification-workflow-packet-consultation

## Verdict

GO on proposal 001 (WI-5694 cycle 2). Narrow verification-finalization evidence clearance in `implementation_start_gate.py` correctly consumes cycle-1 `assess_packet_terminal_evidence` with fail-closed fall-through, corridor-keyed to the canonical finalize-verified helper, and preserves active-authority semantics for non-corridor commands. Exact two-path scope and PAUTH under Bridge Protocol Reliability are adequate.

## Findings

_No blocking proposal defects._

## Required Revisions

_None._

## Commands Executed

- applicability + mandatory clause preflight → passed / 0 blocking gaps


## First-Line Role Eligibility And Review Independence

## Clause Applicability (Slice 2; mandatory gate)

## Clause Applicability (Slice 2; mandatory gate)

- Bridge id: `gtkb-wi5694-verification-workflow-packet-consultation`
- Operative file: `bridge\gtkb-wi5694-verification-workflow-packet-consultation-001.md`
- Clauses evaluated: 5
- must_apply: 4, may_apply: 1, not_applicable: 0
- Evidence gaps in must_apply clauses: 0
- Blocking gaps (gate-failing): 0
- Mode: **mandatory** (default invocation). Exit 5 = blocking gap; exit 0 = pass.

| Clause | Spec | Applicability | Evidence found | Severity | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ADR-ISOLATION-APPLICATION-PLACEMENT-001/CLAUSE-IN-ROOT` | `ADR-ISOLATION-APPLICATION-PLACEMENT-001` | must_apply | yes | blocking | blocking |
| `GOV-FILE-BRIDGE-AUTHORITY-001/CLAUSE-NUMBERED-FILE-CHAIN-IS-CANONICAL` | `GOV-FILE-BRIDGE-AUTHORITY-001` | must_apply | yes | blocking | blocking |
| `DCL-IMPLEMENTATION-PROPOSAL-SPEC-LINKAGE-MANDATORY-001/CLAUSE-CONCRETE-LINKS` | `DCL-IMPLEMENTATION-PROPOSAL-SPEC-LINKAGE-MANDATORY-001` | must_apply | yes | blocking | blocking |
| `DCL-VERIFIED-SPEC-DERIVED-TESTING-MANDATORY-001/CLAUSE-SPEC-TO-TEST-MAPPING` | `DCL-VERIFIED-SPEC-DERIVED-TESTING-MANDATORY-001` | must_apply | yes | blocking | blocking |
| `GOV-STANDING-BACKLOG-001/CLAUSE-VISIBILITY-BULK-OPS` | `GOV-STANDING-BACKLOG-001` | may_apply | â€” | blocking | blocking |

_Slice 2 mandatory gate: clauses with `enforcement_mode = "blocking"` and
must_apply applicability fail the gate (exit 5) when evidence is absent and
no `Owner waiver: <clause_id> â€” <DELIB-ID> â€” <reason>` line is cited.
Clauses with `enforcement_mode = "advisory"` are reported but never gate._
