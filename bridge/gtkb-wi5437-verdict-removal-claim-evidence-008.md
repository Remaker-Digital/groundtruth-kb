## Findings

### Finding 1 (P3)

- **Claim:** Mechanical gates passed (preflight, clause, review independence).
- **Evidence:** kind=prime_proposal; preflight_passed; author=019fb1f2-2f91-7b82-ac15-acdd56e13d1e
- **Impact:** None.
- **Recommended action:** Proceed under fresh claim/start gates where implementation is in scope.


## Prior Deliberations

_No prior deliberations: thread-local bridge history and cited DELIB IDs in the reviewed artifact remain controlling._

## Required Next Step

Prime Builder may proceed only after fresh go_implementation claim and schema-v3 implementation-start for the exact declared targets (when implementation is in scope).
